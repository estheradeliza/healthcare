## Evolving Landscape of AI in the Hemangioma in Healthcare Industry

Although AIâ€™s application in hemangioma care is in its early stages, it is starting to assist in diagnosing and monitoring lesion development. AI algorithms can differentiate hemangiomas from malignant skin conditions and vascular malformations. AI can also support pediatricians in tracking growth and involution through image recognition and time-series analysis.

## Emerging AI Technologies Driving the Hemangioma Market Forward

AI-driven imaging analysis is helping detect and categorize infantile hemangiomas based on severity and likely progression. Mobile applications using AI can assist parents and pediatricians in remote monitoring. AI is also being tested in predictive modeling to determine which hemangiomas may need treatment versus those that will regress naturally.

## Hemangioma industryâ€™s Recent Statistics (2023â€“2025)

The global hemangioma market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 6.4% from 2023 to 2025, reaching approximately USD 1.8 billion by 2025. North America holds a major share due to higher diagnosis rates and access to pediatric care. The AI-supported diagnostic segment is still emerging but is gaining traction, especially in telehealth-based dermatology.

## Key Trends Shaping the Future of AI in the Hemangioma industry

Trends include increased use of oral beta-blockers for systemic treatment, growing demand for non-invasive laser therapy, and rising use of teledermatology for pediatric consultations. AI-based mobile monitoring apps for parents and clinicians are gaining interest.
